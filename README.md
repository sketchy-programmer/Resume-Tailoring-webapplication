💡 *Tip:* Add a `package.json` and dependencies section here if available.

### 🔹 Backend (`server` folder)
Likely includes:
- **Node.js / Express** – JavaScript backend server  
- **API routes** to handle resume tailoring, requests, and responses

Backend responsibilities:
- Receive resume + job description
